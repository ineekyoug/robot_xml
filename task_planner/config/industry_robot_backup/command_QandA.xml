   <question id="force_sensor">
      <voice> 
         首先，我们的原位力感知传感器采用了无弹性体设计，这样它就能与传动部件紧密结合，实现了超高的刚度。这样的设计突破了空间和重量的限制，让我们的机器人核心部件变得更加轻薄；
         接着，我们的微型六维力传感器还采用了硅应变敏感技术，能够非常灵敏地感知到力量的变化；
         再加上我们突破性的低应力技术，让传感器的精度更高，而且串扰的影响更低，能够精确地感知到周围的每一个微小变化。
         最后，我们把这些轻量化、高精度的力感知技术融合在一起，让我们的机器人实现了更紧凑的本体结构，更精细、更安全的人机协作。

      <voice_en> 
         First, our in-situ force sensor uses an elastic-free design, allowing it to tightly integrate with the transmission components, achieving an ultra-high stiffness. This design breakthrough overcomes the limitations of space and weight, making our robot's core components more lightweight and thin.
         Next, our mini six-axis force sensor also uses silicon strain-sensitive technology, which can very sensitively detect changes in force.
         Plus, our breakthrough low-stress technology makes the sensor more accurate and reduces the impact of crosstalk, allowing it to precisely perceive every tiny change in the surroundings.
         Finally, we've integrated these lightweight, high-precision force sensing technologies to enable our robots to have a more compact structure and more delicate, safer human-robot collaboration.

         我们的3D视觉相机使用了自主研发的低成本、高可靠的柔性MOEMS光电扫描技术。这个技术就像是给机器人的眼睛装上了超级灵活的眼球，能够在保证人眼安全的同时，
         不增加总光功率，让双目视觉中的散斑数量提高5倍以上，这样就能大幅提高双目视觉系统的检测精度两倍以上。
         而且，我们的相机还突破了传统双目视觉在精细任务中的技术瓶颈，提供了一个性价比极高的解决方案。这意味着我们的机器人能够在各种使用场景中，
         无论是在明亮的白天还是在昏暗的夜晚，都能看得更清楚、更准确，完成更多精细的任务
      </voice>
      <voice_en> 
         Our 3D vision camera uses our own low-cost, high-reliability flexible MOEMS optoelectronic scanning technology. 
         This technology is like equipping the robot's eyes with super flexible eyeballs, 
         which can increase the speckle quantity in binocular vision by more than 5 times without increasing the total optical power, 
         while ensuring human eye safety. This significantly improves the detection accuracy of the binocular vision system by more than double.
         Moreover, our camera has also broken through the technical bottlenecks of traditional binocular vision in fine tasks, offering a cost-effective solution. 
         This means our robots can see more clearly and accurately in various scenarios, 
         whether it's bright daylight or dim nighttime, and accomplish more delicate tasks

      <voice_en> 
         We've developed a multi-tactile soft and dexterous hand with a human-like gripping design that can adapt to hold different tools and provide a stronger grip.
         In terms of finger design, our dexterous hand is also uniquely thoughtful, using active joints with a high grip-to-weight ratio, offering 10 times the grip force, while also enabling the thumb to rotate 120° and the four fingers to rotate 140°.
         To ensure operational safety, we've also added adaptive soft anti-collision rebound in the fingers to prevent unexpected damage in case of abnormal collisions.
         Finally, our hand is equipped with our own soft and ultra-thin tactile sensors, which can provide 14 high-density sensitive units on a single finger surface, effectively providing multidimensional sensory information to the robot.

      <voice_en> 
         Our tactile sensors are super thin and flexible, using high-precision contact-based piezoresistive sensing technology. 
         It's like we've put the robot in a pair of super sensitive gloves, ensuring it can reliably sense touch from the outside.
         Plus, our sensors use a stacked sensitive unit packaging integration, kind of like stacking lots of tiny sensors on top of each other, 
         which achieves miniaturization and lightweighting of the sensors.
         Our sensors are also very power-efficient, with a power consumption as low as 0.3W, allowing them to work for a long time without using much energy.
         The coolest part is that our sensors can provide 14 high-density sensitive units on a single finger surface,
